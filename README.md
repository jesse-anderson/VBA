# VBA
All VBA code that I have written.

##MSLC Tracker 
This VBA program was written to automate the task of taking attendance in tutoring/discussion sections through blackboard collaborate. BB collab exports a .csv file that is then downloaded by me and can contain multiple rejoins and is often times not alphabetized. So inputting attendance for a student is annoying as is counting the amount of students, the average time they were in the session, and what percentage of the time I was tutoring in relation to the average time a student was present. This VBA code automates all of that based on the input of how long the person was tutoring. It alphabetizes the names and deletes doubles and adds the times together. After that it gives attendance data such as average time in session, count of students, and how long students were in the session in relation to how long the session went on. Note that the time for the particular session referenced was 150 minutes.
